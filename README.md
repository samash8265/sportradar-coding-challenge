# sportradar-coding-challenge

This is my first time uploading to github, so we'll see if everything works. But, I completeled both ETL Pipelines for the Teams and Players. I approached both Pipelines the same way of:

1. Extracting the Data from the API's through multiple Request-Promise functions
2. Transforming the Data into the correct format through a simple call-return function
3. Finally loading the transformed data into a csv file in a folder. (teamdata.csv and playerdata.csv)

I had a hard time finding Player ID's on NHL Players, so my testing of that was limited. I'm pretty sure my Team Pipeline was able to pass the few tests I threw at it.
